```action/2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: The predicate action/2 as it is, is "contingent".

This is because it relies on the predicate world/1 (which creates a subset of all
possible world by applying the predicate restriction/1 on the set). As
a consequence, the predicate rho/2 and perform/3 are contingent.

TODO: change the predicate so as it is generally valid and delete
world/1.


** rho/1 **
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem: The predicate rho/2 is "contingent".

See above for details.

TODO: Correct action/2


** perform/3 **

Problem: The predicate perform/3 is "contingent".
